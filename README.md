## Project ideas

### Hyggebike

Use Open Street Map to route the best most hyggelige bike routes. In contrast to normal route planners, this should not strictly be based on travel time, but also a proprietary "hygge score", which balances optimal travel time with a nice comfy route. 


### Bike route with best chance of bird obervations
jeg kigger på fugle, hvorfor ik', hvorfor ik' når de sidde på min hæk

### Identify areas with good public transportation and few observations of animals, to suggest new housing development areas.


### Hiking route for person with bowel problems/For planning hiking routes with children who haven't learned to pee ahead of time

Toiletdata available from GeoData, routeplanning on network with different levels of restraints on max distance to a toilet at all times. 

### Terrorist planning tool to make bird observers have a hard time getting to see birds or to make people with bowel problems have a hard time getting to a toilet, or to make bird observers with bowel movements have a really bad day

Which road intersections, travel hubs, etc. should we bomb to the ground in order to create the most chaos? To do this, we inspect the road network to find the most "important" nodes and edges under some importance notion, and investigate the effect on the network if it were to be removed. 

### Track routes/location of best climbers

To have the best chance of finding the best climbers, have location and time of ascents of climbing routes, and suggest routes that go to the same locations.


### Public transport pubcrawl route

Suggest pubs for each stop along a public transportation route

### Bike route panner

Route Planning: Users can specify their origin and destination through an interactive map interface or text search.

Bike-Friendly Routing: The routing algorithm will prioritize roads with designated bike infrastructure (bike lanes, paths) 
obtained from open-source data sources. In the absence of bike infrastructure, the algorithm will favor low-traffic roads suitable for cycling.

Elevation Profile (Optional): The tool can display the elevation profile of the route to help cyclists gauge the difficulty of the ride.

Points of Interest (POI) Along Route (Optional):
The tool can display a variety of POIs relevant to cyclists along the route, based on selections done by the user


### Spatial music analysis/recommender

Develop a tool that uses geospatial data to analyze the relationship between music and location. This can involve mapping music genres or artists to specific geographic areas, identifying patterns in music preferences based on location, and recommending music based on a user's current location or desired destination. The tool can leverage geospatial data sources such as music streaming platforms, concert databases, and user-generated location data to provide personalized music recommendations with a spatial context.


### Streetlight 

What's the safest way to get home after a night out?

### Streetlight expansion

Where should streetlights be added for optimal infrastructure growth?

## Copilot ideas

### Real-time Traffic Analysis

Develop a tool that uses real-time traffic data to analyze traffic patterns and provide insights for optimizing routes. This can include identifying congested areas, suggesting alternative routes, and predicting travel times based on historical data.

### Urban Heat Island Mapping

Use satellite imagery and geospatial analysis techniques to map urban heat islands in cities. This can help identify areas with high temperatures and guide urban planning efforts to mitigate the heat island effect.

### Flood Risk Assessment

Combine elevation data, hydrological models, and historical flood data to assess flood risk in different areas. This can help in urban planning, emergency response planning, and insurance risk assessment.

### Public Transportation Accessibility

Develop a tool that calculates and visualizes the accessibility of public transportation in a city. This can include analyzing walking distances to transit stops, evaluating the coverage of different transit modes, and identifying areas with limited access to public transportation.

### Green Space Analysis

Use satellite imagery and land cover data to analyze the distribution and accessibility of green spaces in urban areas. This can help in urban planning efforts to improve access to parks and recreational areas.

### Noise Pollution Mapping

Combine noise sensor data with geospatial analysis techniques to map noise pollution levels in cities. This can help identify areas with high noise levels and guide urban planning efforts to mitigate noise pollution.

### Air Quality Monitoring

Develop a tool that collects and analyzes air quality data from different sources to provide real-time air quality information for different areas. This can help individuals make informed decisions about outdoor activities and guide urban planning efforts to improve air quality.

### Historical Land Use Analysis

Use historical maps and satellite imagery to analyze changes in land use over time. This can provide insights into urban development patterns, identify areas of urban sprawl, and guide future land use planning.

### Disaster Response Planning

Develop a tool that uses geospatial data to assist in disaster response planning. This can include identifying evacuation routes, mapping critical infrastructure, and analyzing the vulnerability of different areas to natural disasters.

### Urban Growth Projection

Use population data, land use data, and spatial modeling techniques to project future urban growth and its impact on infrastructure and resources. This can help in long-term urban planning and resource allocation.
